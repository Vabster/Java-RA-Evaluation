# Java - B+ Tree Indexing, Relational Algebra times
An Extention of the B+ Tree Indexing Repository

This is an extention of the "Java B+ Tree Indexing" repository. The BPTreeTimes.java file tests the times it takes for the B+ Tree Indexing to perform several of the relational algebra methods, on varying table sizes. It does this for indexed join, ranged select, and point select.

A indexedJoin function was added to the BPTreeTable.java class rather than the nested loop join function that was used in earlier editions.
